With this 1.0.0 branche of map-tools, I'm undergoind profound
modifications in common_bracket kernel. 
Instead of having to define several buffer-local variables to decide
which brackets will be supported with files of a given filetype (and
instead of having several behaviours hard coded (like how {} expands in
(La)TeX, ...)), now the brackets are define with a new command: :Brackets

BTW, a few files from other modules (like lh-cpp) are available here for
the moment, they will be moved to lh-cpp once v1.0.0 kernel of
common_brackets is stabilized.
